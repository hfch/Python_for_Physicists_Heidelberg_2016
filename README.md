# Python_for_Physicists_Heidelberg_2016

The goal of my lectures it to teach physik-students on the master and
PhD level how to efficiently and flexibly solve programming
problems with the easy-to-learn, high-level programming language
Python.

## Preconditions for the course
I assume that participants of the course have previous programming
experience with a language such as *C*, *Fortran* or *Java*. The most
important aspect is that you know *how to solve problems* with your
language.

- If you would like to brush up your programming / problem solving
  skills before the course, you could consider some problems from
  [ProjectEuler](https://projecteuler.net/archives) which offers a
  great ressource for mathemtically oriented programming problems on
  all levels. With your prior knowledge, you should be able to solve
  problems 1-15 without too much effort in your favourite programming
  language.

- If you would like to learn some basic *Python* before the course, I
  recommend the excellent, freely-available book
  [ThinkPython](http://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python/). Chapters 1-14
  contain topics that you should be familiar with in your programming language.

## Computer / Laptop setup
Every student will work actively with an own computer. I expect that
about half of you will bring their own Laptops and necessary setups
are described [here]().
